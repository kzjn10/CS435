This a fun course. We will work on many problems including those in LeetCode. 

We will explore FOUR well-known problem-solving techniques:

 - DAC (Divide And Conquer)
 - Dynamic Programming
 - Greedy Algorithms
 - Backtracking

# DAC for solving problems with non-overlapping subproblems.

 - Binary Search on a sorted array
 - Find Max
 - Find the odd coin from 3n coins
 - Merge Sort

# Dynamic Programming for solving problems with overlapping subproblems.

 - Nth Fibonacci Number
 - Computation of n Choose r
 - Climbing Stairs (LeetCode 70)
 - Minimum Path Sum (LeetCode 64)
 - Coin Change (Minimum number of coins) (LeetCode 322)
 - Coin Change II (Number of ways) (LeetCode 518)
 - Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
 - Subset Sum Problem
 - Integer Knapsack
 - Dijkstra’s Dynamic Programming Algorithm on digraphs

# Greedy Algorithms
